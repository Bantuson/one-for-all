## Trajectory Analysis

### Expected Behavior

```
1. identity_auth_agent: Verify identity -> Generate OTP -> Confirm -> Generate student number
2. application_intake_agent: Collect personal info -> Capture course choices -> Handle documents
3. rag_specialist_agent: Calculate APS -> Check eligibility -> Suggest alternatives if needed
4. submission_agent: Assemble payload -> Submit to institution(s) -> Confirm
5. nsfas_agent: Check eligibility -> Reuse data -> Collect additional info -> Submit
```

### Actual Behavior

```
1. identity_auth_agent: SA ID verification -> OTP generated -> Confirmed -> MSc student number assigned
2. application_intake_agent: Captured Honours qualification (75%, NWU 2021) -> Research experience documented -> First choice NWU MSc Physics (research), second choice Wits MSc Physics
3. rag_specialist_agent: Verified Honours as prerequisite (75% > 65% required) -> Research potential confirmed -> Same institution continuation noted -> Both programmes eligible
4. submission_agent: Submitted to NWU (primary) and Wits (backup) -> Both confirmations received
5. nsfas_agent: Identified as postgraduate (MSc) -> SKIPPED entire NSFAS flow (correct behavior)
```

### Deviations

| Step | Expected | Actual | Severity |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

## Observations

### What Worked Well
- **CRITICAL**: Postgraduate NSFAS skip working correctly (100% expected for MSc postgrad)
- Research-based Masters workflow handled correctly without APS calculation
- BSc Honours qualification (75%, NWU 2021) properly captured
- Research experience (Honours project, lab assistant, conference paper) documented
- Same institution progression (NWU Honours -> NWU MSc) correctly processed
- Honours percentage (75%) validated against requirement (65%+)
- Multi-institution submission (NWU + Wits) for research Masters programmes
- STEM field requirements properly handled

### What Needs Improvement
- NSFAS skip message should be postgrad-specific rather than generic "household income exceeding threshold"
- Future: Add NRF/research funding alternatives lookup for STEM postgrads

### Unexpected Behaviors
- None - postgraduate MSc workflow completed as expected

---

## Recommendations

### Agent Improvements
- Add postgraduate-specific NSFAS skip message in nsfas_agent
- Consider adding research funding guidance (NRF Masters/Doctoral scholarships)

### Prompt Adjustments
- None required - baseline passed for MSc research postgraduate workflow

### Tool Enhancements
- Future: Add NRF scholarship eligibility checker for STEM postgrads
- Future: Add research output verification tool (publications, conference papers)
- Future: Add same-institution progression flag (Honours -> Masters at same university)
