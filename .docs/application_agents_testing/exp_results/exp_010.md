## Trajectory Analysis

### Expected Behavior

```
1. identity_auth_agent: Verify identity -> Generate OTP -> Confirm -> Generate student number
2. application_intake_agent: Collect personal info -> Capture course choices -> Handle documents
3. rag_specialist_agent: Calculate APS -> Check eligibility -> Suggest alternatives if needed
4. submission_agent: Assemble payload -> Submit to institution(s) -> Confirm
5. nsfas_agent: Check eligibility -> Reuse data -> Collect additional info -> Submit
```

### Actual Behavior

```
1. identity_auth_agent: SA ID verification -> OTP generated -> Confirmed -> UP student number assigned
2. application_intake_agent: Captured high achiever details (APS 37) -> IT Olympiad/hackathon noted -> First choice BSc CS, second choice BIT at UP
3. rag_specialist_agent: Verified APS 37 exceeds both requirements (32 and 28) -> Both choices eligible -> Maths 80% exceeds 60% requirement
4. submission_agent: Submitted to University of Pretoria -> Both choices confirmed
5. nsfas_agent: Eligible (< R350K income, civil servant parents) -> Data reused from intake -> NSFAS application compiled
```

### Deviations

| Step | Expected | Actual | Severity |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

## Observations

### What Worked Well
- High-achiever profile (APS 37) processed correctly with all subjects verified
- IT Olympiad and hackathon achievements captured appropriately
- Both course choices at UP correctly verified as eligible
- Maths requirement (60%+) validated against student's 80%
- NSFAS eligibility correctly determined (< R350K household income)
- Civil servant parents' employment status handled correctly
- Single NSFAS application model working for multi-institution context
- All documents available - complete application packet
- Portfolio (coding projects) noted for CS application

### What Needs Improvement
- Future: Multi-institution submission (4 universities) not fully tested in this run
- Future: Cross-institution tracking for single applicant
- Consider adding IT portfolio upload for tech-focused programmes

### Unexpected Behaviors
- None - high-achiever workflow completed as expected

---

## Recommendations

### Agent Improvements
- Consider parallel submission to multiple institutions for comprehensive multi-institution test
- Add IT/coding portfolio evaluation for CS programmes

### Prompt Adjustments
- None required - baseline passed

### Tool Enhancements
- Future: Add multi-institution submission batch tool
- Future: Add portfolio/project link verification tool for tech applications
- Future: Add cross-institution application status tracker
