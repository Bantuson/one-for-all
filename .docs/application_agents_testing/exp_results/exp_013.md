## Trajectory Analysis

### Expected Behavior

```
1. identity_auth_agent: Verify identity -> Generate OTP -> Confirm -> Generate student number
2. application_intake_agent: Collect personal info -> Capture course choices -> Handle documents
3. rag_specialist_agent: Calculate APS -> Check eligibility -> Suggest alternatives if needed
4. submission_agent: Assemble payload -> Submit to institution(s) -> Confirm
5. nsfas_agent: Check eligibility -> Reuse data -> Collect additional info -> Submit
```

### Actual Behavior

```
1. identity_auth_agent: SA ID verification -> OTP generated -> Confirmed -> PhD student number assigned
2. application_intake_agent: Captured full qualification chain (BSc 75% -> Honours 78% -> MSc Distinction) -> 5 publications noted -> Research assistant role captured -> First choice UKZN, second choice UCT
3. rag_specialist_agent: Verified MSc Distinction as prerequisite -> Research track validated -> Supervisor requirement noted -> Both PhD programmes eligible
4. submission_agent: Submitted to UKZN (primary) and UCT (backup) -> Research proposal (draft) attached -> Both confirmations received
5. nsfas_agent: Identified as postgraduate (PhD) -> SKIPPED entire NSFAS flow -> NRF pathway noted as alternative
```

### Deviations

| Step | Expected | Actual | Severity |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

## Observations

### What Worked Well
- PhD candidate workflow handled correctly with full academic chain verification
- Complete qualification chain captured (BSc -> Honours -> MSc with Distinction)
- Research experience (5 peer-reviewed publications, 3 conferences) properly noted
- Current research assistant position at UKZN captured
- NRF scholarship history (Masters) recognized
- Best poster award and academic highlights noted
- Laboratory manager experience captured
- Supervisor requirement for PhD handled appropriately
- Research proposal (draft) attachment supported
- Multi-institution submission (UKZN + UCT) successful
- NSFAS correctly skipped for doctoral candidate

### What Needs Improvement
- Future: Add NRF doctoral scholarship application integration
- Future: Add supervisor matching/availability checker tool

### Unexpected Behaviors
- None - academic track PhD workflow completed as expected

---

## Recommendations

### Agent Improvements
- Add PhD-specific NSFAS skip message mentioning NRF as alternative funding
- Consider adding doctoral funding guidance (NRF, industry, international scholarships)

### Prompt Adjustments
- None required - baseline passed

### Tool Enhancements
- Future: Add NRF doctoral scholarship application integration
- Future: Add supervisor matching/availability checker tool
- Future: Add publication verification tool (Google Scholar, ORCID)
- Future: Add research proposal template generator
