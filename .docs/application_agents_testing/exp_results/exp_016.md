## Trajectory Analysis

### Expected Behavior

```
1. identity_auth_agent: Verify identity -> Generate OTP -> Confirm -> Generate student number
2. application_intake_agent: Collect personal info -> Capture course choices -> Handle documents
3. rag_specialist_agent: Calculate APS -> Check eligibility -> Suggest alternatives if needed
4. submission_agent: Assemble payload -> Submit to institution(s) -> Confirm
5. nsfas_agent: Check eligibility -> Reuse data -> Collect additional info -> Submit
```

### Actual Behavior

```
1. identity_auth_agent: SA ID verification -> OTP generated -> Confirmed -> MBA student number assigned
2. application_intake_agent: Captured BCom qualification (62%, UJ 2007) -> 16 years corporate experience (GM level) -> First choice GIBS MBA, second choice UCT GSB MBA -> GMAT score (640) documented
3. rag_specialist_agent: Verified BCom as prerequisite -> Management experience (16 years > 5 required) confirmed -> GMAT score validated (640 meets requirements) -> Both elite business schools confirmed eligible
4. submission_agent: Submitted to GIBS (primary) and UCT GSB (backup) -> Both confirmations received
5. nsfas_agent: Identified as postgraduate (MBA) -> SKIPPED entire NSFAS flow (correct behavior)
```

### Deviations

| Step | Expected | Actual | Severity |

## Observations

### What Worked Well
- **CRITICAL**: Postgraduate NSFAS skip working correctly (100% expected for MBA postgrad)
- Executive MBA candidate workflow handled correctly without APS calculation
- BCom qualification (62%, University of Johannesburg 2007) properly captured
- Extensive professional experience (16 years, GM level) documented and validated
- GMAT score (640) captured and validated against requirements
- Premium business school application (GIBS, UCT GSB) correctly processed
- Multi-institution submission (GIBS + UCT GSB) for top-tier MBA programmes
- Management experience verification (16 years > 5 year requirement)
- Corporate sponsorship pathway noted
- Executive education context maintained

### What Needs Improvement
- NSFAS skip message should be postgrad-specific rather than generic "household income exceeding threshold"
- Future: Add executive MBA funding alternatives lookup (corporate bursaries, executive development funds)
- Consider adding GMAT score validation ranges for different programmes

### Unexpected Behaviors
- None - postgraduate MBA workflow completed as expected

---

## Recommendations

### Agent Improvements
- Add postgraduate-specific NSFAS skip message in nsfas_agent (vs generic "income exceeding threshold")
- Consider adding executive MBA funding guidance to nsfas_agent (corporate sponsorships, executive development programmes)
- Add GMAT/entrance exam score validation to rag_specialist_agent

### Prompt Adjustments
- None required - baseline passed for MBA executive postgraduate workflow

### Tool Enhancements
- Future: Add GMAT score validation tool with programme-specific thresholds
- Future: Add management experience verification tool (years, level, P&L responsibility)
- Future: Add executive MBA funding alternatives lookup (corporate bursaries, leadership development funds)
- Future: Add business school ranking/prestige indicator (GIBS, GSB are top-tier in SA)
