## Trajectory Analysis

### Expected Behavior

```
1. identity_auth_agent: Verify identity -> Generate OTP -> Confirm -> Generate student number
2. application_intake_agent: Collect personal info -> Capture course choices -> Handle documents
3. rag_specialist_agent: Calculate APS -> Check eligibility -> Suggest alternatives if needed
4. submission_agent: Assemble payload -> Submit to institution(s) -> Confirm
5. nsfas_agent: Check eligibility -> Reuse data -> Collect additional info -> Submit
```

### Actual Behavior

```
1. identity_auth_agent: SA ID verification -> OTP generated -> Confirmed -> Masters student number assigned
2. application_intake_agent: Captured qualification chain (BCom 65% + Honours 72%) -> 8 years professional experience noted -> Senior Economist role captured -> First choice UCT, second choice Stellenbosch
3. rag_specialist_agent: Verified Honours 72% > 65% minimum -> 9-year gap since Honours handled -> Both MCom programmes eligible
4. submission_agent: Submitted to UCT (primary) and Stellenbosch (backup) -> Part-time/coursework option noted -> Both confirmations received
5. nsfas_agent: Identified as postgraduate (Masters) + employed -> SKIPPED entire NSFAS flow (correct behavior)
```

### Deviations

| Step | Expected | Actual | Severity |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

## Observations

### What Worked Well
- Masters candidate workflow handled correctly with qualification chain verification
- Multiple previous qualifications captured (BCom 2014 + Honours 2015)
- Long gap since Honours (9 years) handled without issues
- Working professional context (8 years experience) properly noted
- Senior Economist role and industry reports captured
- Part-time/coursework study option handled for employed professional
- Employer sponsorship context acknowledged
- Honours dissertation distinction noted
- Multi-institution submission (UCT + Stellenbosch) successful
- NSFAS correctly skipped for postgraduate + employed applicant

### What Needs Improvement
- Future: Add employer study policy verification tool
- Future: Track part-time vs full-time programme options explicitly

### Unexpected Behaviors
- None - working professional Masters workflow completed as expected

---

## Recommendations

### Agent Improvements
- Add specific message for dual postgrad+employed NSFAS ineligibility
- Consider adding employer bursary/sponsorship guidance

### Prompt Adjustments
- None required - baseline passed

### Tool Enhancements
- Future: Add employer study policy verification tool
- Future: Add part-time programme availability checker
- Future: Add professional body membership verification (Economic Society of SA)
