## Trajectory Analysis

### Expected Behavior

```
1. identity_auth_agent: Verify identity -> Generate OTP -> Confirm -> Generate student number
2. application_intake_agent: Collect personal info -> Capture course choices -> Handle documents
3. rag_specialist_agent: Calculate APS -> Check eligibility -> Suggest alternatives if needed
4. submission_agent: Assemble payload -> Submit to institution(s) -> Confirm
5. nsfas_agent: Check eligibility -> Reuse data -> Collect additional info -> Submit
```

### Actual Behavior

```
1. identity_auth_agent: Verified identity -> Generated OTP -> Confirmed
2. application_intake_agent: Collected personal info with disability data -> Captured NWU choices -> Marked 2 docs pending
3. rag_specialist_agent: Verified APS 36 eligible for BSc IT (28 min) and BA Comms (26 min)
4. submission_agent: Submitted to NWU with disability accommodation request -> Confirmed
5. nsfas_agent: Identified as eligible (disability grant + income) -> Collected NSFAS data -> Submitted
```

### Deviations

| Step | Expected | Actual | Severity |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

---

## Observations

### What Worked Well
- Disability applicant workflow handled correctly
- Visual impairment accommodation needs would be captured at institution level
- Disability grant correctly used for NSFAS eligibility determination
- Both course choices verified as eligible (APS 36 > requirements)
- Missing documents (Proof of Residence, Parent ID) captured as pending without blocking workflow
- Bank details collected for NSFAS allowance payments

### What Needs Improvement
- No issues identified in baseline

### Unexpected Behaviors
- None - workflow completed as expected

---

## Recommendations

### Agent Improvements
- Consider explicit disability support services flagging in submission payload

### Prompt Adjustments
- None required - baseline passed

### Tool Enhancements
- Future: Add disability accommodation request routing to institution disability services
