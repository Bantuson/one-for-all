## Trajectory Analysis

### Expected Behavior

```
1. identity_auth_agent: Verify identity -> Generate OTP -> Confirm -> Generate student number
2. application_intake_agent: Collect personal info -> Capture course choices -> Handle documents
3. rag_specialist_agent: Calculate APS -> Check eligibility -> Suggest alternatives if needed
4. submission_agent: Assemble payload -> Submit to institution(s) -> Confirm
5. nsfas_agent: Check eligibility -> Reuse data -> Collect additional info -> Submit
```

### Actual Behavior

```
1. identity_auth_agent: Standard SA ID verification -> OTP generated -> Confirmed -> UNISA student number assigned
2. application_intake_agent: Captured mature applicant details (age 29) -> Recorded 8 years work experience -> National Certificate noted -> First/second choice at UNISA
3. rag_specialist_agent: Verified 2013 matric results still valid -> APS 32 confirmed -> Both BCom choices eligible (28 and 24 min APS)
4. submission_agent: Submitted to UNISA as distance learning application -> Confirmed
5. nsfas_agent: Identified as ineligible (employed, R480K income) -> SKIPPED entire NSFAS flow
```

### Deviations

| Step | Expected | Actual | Severity |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

## Observations

### What Worked Well
- Mature student (age 29) workflow handled correctly without issues
- Old matric results (2013 - 11+ years old) accepted and processed
- Work experience and prior qualifications captured appropriately
- Distance learning institution (UNISA) submission handled correctly
- NSFAS correctly skipped for employed applicant with income above threshold
- Employment status (full-time) properly identified as NSFAS disqualifier
- Both course choices correctly assessed as eligible

### What Needs Improvement
- Future: Add Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) assessment for mature students
- Future: Track employer study assistance/bursary options for employed applicants

### Unexpected Behaviors
- None - mature student workflow completed as expected

---

## Recommendations

### Agent Improvements
- Add employment-based NSFAS skip message (vs generic "income exceeding threshold")
- Consider mature student specific guidance for RPL pathways

### Prompt Adjustments
- None required - baseline passed

### Tool Enhancements
- Future: Add employer bursary/study assistance lookup tool
- Future: Add RPL eligibility assessment tool for mature students
- Future: Add distance learning specific requirements checker
