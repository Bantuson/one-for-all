## Trajectory Analysis

### Expected Behavior

```
1. identity_auth_agent: Verify identity -> Generate OTP -> Confirm -> Generate student number
2. application_intake_agent: Collect personal info -> Capture LLM programme choices -> Collect previous qualification (LLB) -> Handle documents
3. rag_specialist_agent: Verify LLB eligibility -> Check programme requirements -> Confirm eligibility
4. submission_agent: Assemble payload -> Submit to institution(s) -> Confirm
5. nsfas_agent: Detect postgrad -> Skip with appropriate message
```

### Actual Behavior

```
1. identity_auth_agent: SA ID verification -> OTP generated -> Confirmed -> LLM student number assigned
2. application_intake_agent: Captured professional legal qualification (LLB 72%, Advocate status) -> Legal practice experience (7 years) -> First choice UP (Constitutional Law), second choice Wits (Constitutional Litigation)
3. rag_specialist_agent: Verified LLB as prerequisite -> Professional qualification (Advocate) recognized -> 72% meets 65%+ requirement -> Both programmes eligible
4. submission_agent: Submitted to UP (primary) and Wits (backup) -> Both confirmations received
5. nsfas_agent: Identified as postgraduate (LLM) -> SKIPPED entire NSFAS flow (correct behavior)
```

### Deviations

| Step | Expected | Actual | Severity |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

## Observations

### What Worked Well
- **CRITICAL**: Postgraduate NSFAS skip working correctly (100% expected for LLM postgrad)
- LLM candidate workflow handled correctly without APS calculation
- Professional legal qualification (LLB 72%, Advocate status) properly captured
- Legal practice experience (7 years at the Bar) documented
- Specialized Masters programme (Constitutional Law LLM) correctly identified
- Professional qualification prerequisites (LLB, legal practice) verified
- Multi-institution submission (UP + Wits) for backup option
- Same-institution continuation (UP undergrad -> UP postgrad) noted
- Constitutional law specialization focus maintained across choices

### What Needs Improvement
- NSFAS skip message should be postgrad-specific rather than generic "household income exceeding threshold"
- Future: Add postgraduate funding alternatives lookup (NRF, law firm bursaries, bar council funding)
- Consider adding professional body integration (GCB/Bar Council verification)

### Unexpected Behaviors
- None - postgraduate LLM workflow completed as expected

---

## Recommendations

### Agent Improvements
- Add postgraduate-specific NSFAS skip message in nsfas_agent (vs generic "income exceeding threshold")
- Consider adding NRF/DHET postgraduate funding guidance to nsfas_agent
- Add professional body verification to identity_auth_agent (GCB for legal professionals)

### Prompt Adjustments
- None required - baseline passed for LLM postgraduate workflow

### Tool Enhancements
- Future: Add postgraduate funding alternatives lookup tool (NRF, industry bursaries, research grants)
- Future: Add professional body registration checker (GCB, Law Society, SAICA)
- Future: Add legal practice experience verification tool
- Future: Add specialized Masters programme database (Constitutional Law, Tax Law, etc.)
