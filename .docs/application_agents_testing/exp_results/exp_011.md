### 5. nsfas_agent

| Metric | Target | Actual | Pass/Fail |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Data Reuse Rate | > 80% | N/A (skipped) | Pass |

## Trajectory Analysis

### Expected Behavior

```
1. identity_auth_agent: Verify identity -> Generate OTP -> Confirm -> Generate student number
2. application_intake_agent: Collect personal info -> Capture course choices -> Handle documents
3. rag_specialist_agent: Calculate APS -> Check eligibility -> Suggest alternatives if needed
4. submission_agent: Assemble payload -> Submit to institution(s) -> Confirm
5. nsfas_agent: Check eligibility -> Reuse data -> Collect additional info -> Submit
```

### Actual Behavior

```
1. identity_auth_agent: SA ID verification -> OTP generated -> Confirmed -> Honours student number assigned
2. application_intake_agent: Captured undergrad qualification (BCom Accounting 68%) -> Module results verified -> CTA-ready modules noted -> First choice Wits, second choice UJ
3. rag_specialist_agent: Verified 68% > 60% minimum requirement -> Module prerequisites checked -> Both Honours programmes eligible
4. submission_agent: Submitted to Wits (primary) and UJ (backup) -> Both confirmations received
5. nsfas_agent: Identified as postgraduate (Honours/CTA) -> SKIPPED entire NSFAS flow (correct behavior)
```

### Deviations

| Step | Expected | Actual | Severity |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

## Observations

### What Worked Well
- **CRITICAL**: Postgraduate NSFAS skip working correctly (100% expected for postgrad)
- Honours candidate workflow handled correctly without APS calculation
- Undergraduate qualification (BCom 68%) properly captured and verified
- Module prerequisites (Financial Accounting, Auditing, etc.) noted
- CTA pathway compatibility correctly identified
- Same-institution continuation (Wits undergrad -> Wits Honours) handled
- Multi-institution submission (Wits + UJ) for backup option
- Dean's Merit List achievement captured

### What Needs Improvement
- NSFAS skip message could be postgrad-specific (not generic "income exceeding threshold")
- Future: Add postgraduate funding alternatives lookup (NRF, firm bursaries)

### Unexpected Behaviors
- None - postgraduate Honours workflow completed as expected

---

## Recommendations

### Agent Improvements
- Add postgraduate-specific NSFAS skip message (vs generic "income exceeding threshold")
- Consider adding NRF/DHET postgraduate funding guidance

### Prompt Adjustments
- None required - baseline passed

### Tool Enhancements
- Future: Add postgraduate funding alternatives lookup tool (NRF, industry bursaries)
- Future: Add professional body registration checker (SAICA for CTA)
- Future: Add module prerequisite verification tool
