### 5. nsfas_agent

| Metric | Target | Actual | Pass/Fail |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Data Reuse Rate | > 80% | N/A (skipped) | Pass |
| New Fields Collected | Minimal | 0 (skipped) | Pass |

**Issues Encountered:**
- None

**Notes:**
- NSFAS correctly skipped for international (Zimbabwean/SADC) student
- Skip message generic ("income exceeding threshold") but behavior correct
- nsfas_eligible: No in profile correctly triggered skip logic

## Trajectory Analysis

### Expected Behavior

```
1. identity_auth_agent: Verify identity -> Generate OTP -> Confirm -> Generate student number
2. application_intake_agent: Collect personal info -> Capture course choices -> Handle documents
3. rag_specialist_agent: Calculate APS -> Check eligibility -> Suggest alternatives if needed
4. submission_agent: Assemble payload -> Submit to institution(s) -> Confirm
5. nsfas_agent: Check eligibility -> Reuse data -> Collect additional info -> Submit
```

### Actual Behavior

```
1. identity_auth_agent: Passport-based verification -> Generated OTP -> Confirmed (no SA ID)
2. application_intake_agent: Collected personal info with ZIMSEC A-Level results -> Captured Wits choices -> 4 docs pending
3. rag_specialist_agent: Verified ZIMSEC equivalent APS 32 - Medicine (42 min) likely rejected, BSc BioSci (32 min) eligible
4. submission_agent: Submitted to Wits as international application -> Confirmed
5. nsfas_agent: Identified as ineligible (international student) -> SKIPPED entire NSFAS flow
```

### Deviations

| Step | Expected | Actual | Severity |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

---

## Observations

### What Worked Well
- International student (SADC/Zimbabwe) workflow handled correctly
- Passport-based verification without SA ID number
- ZIMSEC A-Level results processed with SA APS equivalent
- NSFAS correctly skipped for international students
- Study permit and SAQA evaluation flagged as pending documents
- Single institution (Wits) international application submitted

### What Needs Improvement
- NSFAS skip message could be more specific ("international student" vs generic "income exceeding threshold")
- Future: Add explicit SAQA equivalency lookup

### Unexpected Behaviors
- None - international student workflow completed as expected

---

## Recommendations

### Agent Improvements
- Add international student-specific NSFAS skip message

### Prompt Adjustments
- None required - baseline passed

### Tool Enhancements
- Future: Add SAQA qualification equivalency lookup tool
- Future: Add study permit status tracking tool
