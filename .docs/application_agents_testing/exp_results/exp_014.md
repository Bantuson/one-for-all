## Trajectory Analysis

### Expected Behavior

```
1. identity_auth_agent: Verify identity -> Generate OTP -> Confirm -> Generate student number
2. application_intake_agent: Collect personal info -> Capture course choices -> Handle documents
3. rag_specialist_agent: Calculate APS -> Check eligibility -> Suggest alternatives if needed
4. submission_agent: Assemble payload -> Submit to institution(s) -> Confirm
5. nsfas_agent: Check eligibility -> Reuse data -> Collect additional info -> Submit
```

### Actual Behavior

```
1. identity_auth_agent: SA ID verification -> OTP generated -> Confirmed -> PGDip student number assigned
2. application_intake_agent: Captured BEd qualification (62%) -> 5 years teaching experience verified -> Mathematics specialization noted -> First choice UNISA, second choice UP
3. rag_specialist_agent: Verified BEd as prerequisite -> Experience 5 years > 3 required -> Both PGDip programmes eligible
4. submission_agent: Submitted to UNISA (primary) and UP (backup) -> Distance learning option noted -> Both confirmations received
5. nsfas_agent: Identified as postgraduate (PGDip) + employed (teacher) -> SKIPPED entire NSFAS flow (correct behavior)
```

### Deviations

| Step | Expected | Actual | Severity |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

## Observations

### What Worked Well
- PGDip candidate workflow handled correctly with professional development context
- BEd prerequisite (62%) captured and verified against requirements
- 5 years teaching experience validated (exceeds 3 year minimum)
- Mathematics teaching specialization properly noted for second choice
- Government employee status (teacher) correctly identified
- HOD candidate context captured for management programme relevance
- Distance learning institution (UNISA) handling working correctly
- Multi-institution submission (UNISA + UP) successful
- SACE registration and performance reports captured
- NSFAS correctly skipped for postgraduate + employed applicant

### What Needs Improvement
- Future: Add Department of Education bursary application integration
- Future: Verify SACE registration status for education programmes

### Unexpected Behaviors
- None - PGDip career upgrade workflow completed as expected

---

## Recommendations

### Agent Improvements
- Add postgrad+employed specific NSFAS skip message mentioning employer bursaries
- Consider adding professional body verification (SACE for teachers)

### Prompt Adjustments
- None required - baseline passed

### Tool Enhancements
- Future: Add Department of Education bursary application integration
- Future: Add SACE registration verification tool
- Future: Add teaching experience validation tool (years + subject)
