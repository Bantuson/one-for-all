  agent: identity_auth_agent

otp_verification_task:
  description: >
    Send the OTP based on the user's selected method (email, SMS, or WhatsApp).
    The OTP sending tools (sendgrid_otp_sender, sms_otp_sender, send_whatsapp_otp)
    will AUTOMATICALLY generate and store the OTP in the database - do NOT
    fabricate OTP codes.

    After sending, prompt the user to provide the OTP they received.

    Use the verify_otp tool to validate the code against the database:
    - verify_otp(identifier, code) returns "OTP_VALID" or "OTP_INVALID: reason"
    - identifier must match exactly what was used when sending (email or phone)

    ONLY after receiving "OTP_VALID" response:
    - Create user account via supabase_user_store
    - Create 24hr session via supabase_session_create

    If verification fails, inform the user of the specific reason and offer
    to resend using resend_otp_check tool first.

    Your final answer MUST confirm successful account creation with session token.
  expected_output: >
    Confirmation message with session token (only after OTP_VALID verification).
